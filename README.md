## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

To really use Flexbox,

Using 'content property' in css to add images instead of background image or not putting the image in my html.

'em unit' can be used for images and still turn out pretty

### Continued development

I would love to get better at Flex

Start using 'picture element'(srcset) for Responsiveness in my coming projects
